              <strong>Introduction</strong><br />
              MAGUS is a machine learning and graph theory assisted crystal
              structure prediction method developed by Prof. Jian Sun's group at
              the School of Physics at Nanjing University. The programming
              languages are mainly Python and C++ and it is built as a pip
              installable package. Users can use just a few commands to install
              the package. MAGUS has also the advantage of high modularity and
              extensibility. All source codes are transparent to users after
              installation, and users can modify particular parts according to
              their needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              MAGUS has been used to study many systems. Several designed new
              materials have been synthesized experimentally, and a number of
              high-profile academic papers have been published.
            </p>

              <strong>Introduction</strong><br />
              The higher-order tensor message-passing interatomic potential
              function, HotPP, is an E(n)-equivariant message-passing neural
              network capable of extending Cartesian tensor embeddings and
              messages to arbitrary orders. It supports the calculation of
              potential energy surfaces, electric dipole moments, and
              polarizabilities. Additionally, it provides interfaces with
              commonly used software such as ASE and LAMMPS, making it
              applicable for computing phonon spectra, infrared spectra, and
              Raman spectra.

              <strong>Introduction</strong><br />
              GPUMD (Graphics Processing Units Molecular Dynamics) is a high-performance 
              molecular dynamics simulation software package initially developed and 
              maintained by Professor Zheyong Fan and his team, the first version is 
              released in 2017. At recent years, members from Prof. Jian Sun's group, 
              such as Shuning Pan, Yong Wang, Junjie Wang, Qiuhan Jia, Haoting Zhang, 
              Jiuyang Shi, Zhixing Liang, et al.,  made a lot of efforts to contribute. 
              Designed to leverage GPU acceleration, it enables efficient simulations of large-scale systems while
              maintaining high computational accuracy. A key feature of GPUMD is
              its integration of the Neuroevolution Potential (NEP), a
              machine-learning interatomic potential trained via evolutionary
              algorithms, which achieves exceptional computational speed (up to
              10^7 atom-steps per second on consumer-grade GPUs) and precision
              without relying on external ML frameworks like TensorFlow or
              PyTorch. The software supports diverse functionalities including
              NVE, NVT, and NPT ensembles, thermal transport analysis (via
              Green-Kubo, NEMD, and HNEMD methods), structural optimization,
              phonon dispersion calculations, and elastic constant
              determination. Compatible with both Windows and Linux systems,
              GPUMD requires NVIDIA GPUs (compute capability â‰¥3.5) and CUDA
              environments for installation. Its ecosystem includes auxiliary
              tools like PyNEP, GPYUMD, and CALORINE for
              preprocessing/postprocessing and interoperability with platforms
              like ASE and LAMMPS. Widely applied in heat transfer, mechanical
              properties, phase transitions, irradiation damage, and catalysis,
              GPUMD has been utilized in over 130 high-impact publications and
              continues to evolve through active community contributions.
