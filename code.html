            <strong>Introduction</strong><br />
            MAGUS is a machine learning and graph theory assisted crystal
            structure prediction method developed by Prof. Jian Sun's group at
            the School of Physics at Nanjing University. The programming
            languages are mainly Python and C++ and it is built as a pip
            installable package. Users can use just a few commands to install
            the package. MAGUS has also the advantage of high modularity and
            extensibility. All source codes are transparent to users after
            installation, and users can modify particular parts according to
            their needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            MAGUS has been used to study many systems. Several designed new
            materials have been synthesized experimentally, and a number of
            high-profile academic papers have been published.
          </p>

            <strong>Introduction</strong><br />
            The higher-order tensor message-passing interatomic potential
            function, HotPP, is an E(n)-equivariant message-passing neural
            network capable of extending Cartesian tensor embeddings and
            messages to arbitrary orders. It supports the calculation of
            potential energy surfaces, electric dipole moments, and
            polarizabilities. Additionally, it provides interfaces with commonly
            used software such as ASE and LAMMPS, making it applicable for
            computing phonon spectra, infrared spectra, and Raman spectra.

            <strong>Introduction</strong><br />
            GPUMD (Graphics Processing Units Molecular Dynamics) is a
            high-performance molecular dynamics simulation software package
            developed and maintained by Professor Zheyong Fan and his team,
            initially released in 2017. Designed to leverage GPU acceleration,
            it enables efficient simulations of large-scale systems while
            maintaining high computational accuracy. A key feature of GPUMD is
            its integration of the Neuroevolution Potential (NEP), a
            machine-learning interatomic potential trained via evolutionary
            algorithms, which achieves exceptional computational speed (up to
            10^7 atom-steps per second on consumer-grade GPUs) and precision
            without relying on external ML frameworks like TensorFlow or
            PyTorch. The software supports diverse functionalities including
            NVE, NVT, and NPT ensembles, thermal transport analysis (via
            Green-Kubo, NEMD, and HNEMD methods), structural optimization,
            phonon dispersion calculations, and elastic constant determination.
            Compatible with both Windows and Linux systems, GPUMD requires
            NVIDIA GPUs (compute capability ≥3.5) and CUDA environments for
            installation. Its ecosystem includes auxiliary tools like PyNEP,
            GPYUMD, and CALORINE for preprocessing/postprocessing and
            interoperability with platforms like ASE and LAMMPS. Widely applied
            in heat transfer, mechanical properties, phase transitions,
            irradiation damage, and catalysis, GPUMD has been utilized in over
            130 high-impact publications and continues to evolve through active
            community contributions.
